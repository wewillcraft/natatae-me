# NATATAE ME!

The Philippines' Best Crowd-Sourced Public Toilet Finder.

Because finding a clean CR shouldn't be harder than finding true love.

## The Universal Filipino Struggle

Picture this: You're stuck on EDSA, it's been 2 hours, your last coffee just hit
different, and Google Maps doesn't have a "nearest clean toilet" option.

Or maybe you're at the mall, all CRs on your floor are "under maintenance"
(since 1998), Starbucks wants you to buy a ‚Ç±200 frappe for their WiFi password
(which you also need for their CR), and the guard at the fancy restaurant won't
let you in wearing your pambahay outfit.

We've all been there. That's why we built **natatae.me** - your digital kubeta
kasama!

### Our Mission

Transform every Filipino's toilet-finding experience from _"Lord, help me"_ to
_"Found one, salamat natatae.me!"_

## Key Features

### Emergency Mode

**"Natatae Mode"** - One tap shows the 3 nearest toilets. No browsing, no
reviews, just GO!

### Crowd-sourced Reviews

Trust your fellow Kubeta Testers. Real reviews from real people in real
emergencies.

### Smart Filipino Tags

- **Essentials**: Bidet, tabo, tissue, soap
- **Access**: PWD-friendly, senior priority
- **Extras**: Aircon, music, bidets that actually work

### Price Transparency

Know if it's free or ‚Ç±5-20. No surprises when you're already desperate!

### Mall Navigation

"2nd floor, near Jollibee, beside the escalator" - directions that actually make
sense!

### Gamification

Earn badges and titles like:

- ü•â **CR Newbie** (1 review)
- ü•à **Toilet Scout** (10 reviews)
- ü•á **Kubeta King/Queen** (50 reviews)

### Photo Verification

See actual photos. No more "expectation vs reality" surprises!

## Impostor Syndrome Disclaimer

**We want your help. No, really.**

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes.
That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

**Remember:**

- No contribution is too small
- Everyone started somewhere
- Questions are welcome
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Your perspective is valuable

### What This Means For You

The AGPLv3 is a **copyleft** license that promotes software freedom while protecting against whitelabeling:

‚úÖ **You CAN:**

- Use this code for personal or commercial purposes
- Modify and customize it for your needs
- Distribute copies of the original or modified code
- Use it as a backend service (SaaS)

‚ö†Ô∏è **You MUST:**

- **Disclose source code** - Share your modified source code
- **Keep the license** - Include the original AGPLv3 license
- **State changes** - Document any modifications you make
- **Keep attribution** - Credit the original natatae.me project
- **Share alike** - Use AGPLv3 for derivative works
- **Provide source to users** - Even for web services (not just downloads)

‚ùå **You CANNOT:**

- Whitelabel this as your own product without attribution
- Keep modifications private if you offer it as a service
- Change to a different license
- Hold us liable for any issues

### The Network Protection Clause

**This is important:** If you run a modified version of natatae.me on a server and let others use it (even as a web service), you must give them access to your source code. This prevents companies from taking our toilet finder and running it as their proprietary service.

**In Filipino terms:** Parang karinderya recipe - pwede mong gayahin, pwede mong pagandahin, pero kailangan mong sabihin kung saan galing at ibahagi mo rin ang iyong secret ingredient! Hindi pwedeng nakaw na recipe tapos ibebenta mo as "original" mo. üç≤
